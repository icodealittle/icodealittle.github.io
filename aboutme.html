				<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>

				<p>My name is Soumeng Chea, and I am an aspiring Boston-based UX/UI Researcher and Design. I am
					currently a second-year MS in Computer Science candidate at Northeastern University, focusing on
					Computer-Human Interaction. </p>
				<p>Before my Computer Science journey, I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Lowell with a
					bachelor of art in
					Political Science and a minor in French. Now, you wonder why I decided to pursue a Computer Science
					career instead of
					going for any other social science graduate program. Well, I see computer science education as the
					art of thinking about
					problems using logic, pattern recognition, and sub-division into smaller issues. The knowledge would
					allow me to write
					software programs that make computers to accomplish tasks more efficiently. I believe a computer
					science degree's
					versatility will allow me to use my social science problem-solving skills to deal with obstacles
					from a different
					perspective. My interest in computer science comes from my view of the discipline as a challenging
					and creative topic. I
					am eager to study the technological foundation of software engineering and the idea of interaction
					between computers and
					the user resemblance of human-to-human, open-ended
					dialogue.
				</p>

				<p>Outside of the academic setting, I am a huge cooker and baker – I find both activities very
					therapeutic. Besides cooking
					and baking, I also love to try new restaurants and new foods. A traveler – I had lived in Laos for
					four years before my
					family migrated to the United States. My next traveling idea is to make backpacking trips to East
					and Southeast Asia
					countries alone. I currently spoke four languages and would love to learn more – I am advanced in
					oral proficiency in
					Khmer, Laotian, and Thai. At the same time, my French is only at an intermediate level in verbal,
					reading, and writing.</p>
				<p>Now, you're wondering why I decided to have a webpage address as icodealittle. The answer is simple:
					I honestly don't
					have an answer to that.
					I just thought the username is a fun way to describe myself in a new industry.</p>
