				<p>Before my Computer Science journey, I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Lowell with a
					bachelor of art in Political Science and a minor in French. Now, you wonder why I decided to pursue
					a career in Computer Science instead of going for any other social science graudate program. Well, I
					see the computer science education as the art of thinking about problems using logic, pattern
					recognition and sub-division into
					smaller issues. The knowledge would allow me to write software programs that makes computers to
					accomplish tasks more
					efficiently. I believe the versatility of a computer science degree will allow me to use my social
					science problem-solving skills to
					deal with obstacles from a different perspective. My interest in the subject of computer science
					comes from my view of
					the discipline as a challenging and creative topic. I am eager to study the technological foundation
					of software
					engineering and the idea of interaction between computers and the user resemblance of
					human-to-human, open-ended
					dialogue.

				<p>Now, you're wondering why I decided to have a webpage address as icodealittle, right? The answer is
					simple: I honestly don't have an answer to that.
					I just thought the username is a fun way to describe myself in a new industry.</p>
