						<h2 class="major">Easy Animation</h2>
						<p>This project was a part of our academic course – Object-Oriented Design. This easy animation
							project focused on creating
							an animator that had multiple views which rendered the animation by utilizing JAVA
							Object-Oriented Design principle. Through collaboration, my teammate and I also included
							customizable options which allowed the user to manipulate the speed, start/stop point, and
							other aspects of the
							animation. Due to my agreement with the institute, the university requested students not to
							set the assignment codes
							publicly. However, I’m happy to send the file to whomever upon any request.</p>

					<h2 class="major">Outside of coding</h2>
					<p>Outside of the academic setting, I am a huge cooker and baker – I find both activities very
						therapeutic.
						Besides cooking and baking, I also love to try new restaurants and new foods.
						A traveler – I had lived in Laos for four years before my family migrated to the United States.
						My next traveling idea is to make backpacking trips to East and Southeast Asia countries alone.
						I currently spoke four languages and would love to learn more – I am advanced in oral
						proficiency in Khmer, Laotian, and Thai.
						At the same time, my French is only at an intermediate level in verbal, reading, and writing.
