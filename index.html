						<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
						<p>My name is Soumeng Chea, and I am an aspiring Boston-based UX/UI Researcher and Design. I am
							currently a second-year MS
							in Computer Science candidate at Northeastern University, focusing on Computer-Human
							Interaction. This webpage will be a
							tool where I showcase my works through personal projects outside of academia or past and
							current academic projects. You
							will see all the different skills I learn throughout this journey.</p>
						<p>I am currently seeking an internship/co-op opportunity for Spring 2021 or Summer 2021. I have
							a wide range of interests,
							including frontend development, UI/UX research and design, project management, and mobile
							app development.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Facebook Dating: A UX Research Case Study</h2>
						<p>
							Social Media platforms itself is still a relatively new phenomenon. The platform ways in
							which people have been using
							the Internet to interact with one another is continually changing to promote connectivity
							now more than ever. One part
							of social media, in particular, that has been drawing people together in a unique way, is
							online dating.
						</p>

						<p>
							Online dating sites are still considered a new aspect of social media. Websites such as
							Match.com being the first
							official online dating site, which was introduced in 1995. 5 years later, it was followed by
							another online dating
							platform – eHarmony.com, a similar place as Match.com (Matthews, 2018).
						</p>

						<p>
							This case study will be focusing on exploring the online dating experience with Facebook’s
							new feature embedded in the
							official Facebook application. Using the existing matchmaker applications such as Tinder,
							Bumble, and Hinge to compare
							them with Facebook Dating. Furthermore, I will also conduct testing and identifying problems
							through the conceptual
							design and mapping between the controls and the system display.
						</p>

						<p>
							This case study is still in the process of completion.

						<h2 class="major">Easy Animation</h2>
						<p>This project was a part of our academic course – Object-Oriented Design. This easy animation
							project focused on creating
							an animator that had multiple views which rendered the animation by utilizing JAVA
							Object-Oriented Design principle. Through collaboration, my teammate and I also included
							customizable options which allowed the user to manipulate the speed, start/stop point, and
							other aspects of the
							animation. Due to my agreement with the institute, the university requested students not to
							set the assignment codes
							publicly. However, I’m happy to send the file to whomever upon any request.</p>

					<h2 class="major">Outside of coding</h2>
					<p>Outside of the academic setting, I am a huge cooker and baker – I find both activities very
						therapeutic.
						Besides cooking and baking, I also love to try new restaurants and new foods.
						A traveler – I had lived in Laos for four years before my family migrated to the United States.
						My next traveling idea is to make backpacking trips to East and Southeast Asia countries alone.
						I currently spoke four languages and would love to learn more – I am advanced in oral
						proficiency in Khmer, Laotian, and Thai.
						At the same time, my French is only at an intermediate level in verbal, reading, and writing.
