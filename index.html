						<p>
							Social Media platforms itself is still a relatively new phenomenon. The platform ways in
							which people have been using
							the Internet to interact with one another is continually changing to promote connectivity
							now more than ever. One part
							of social media, in particular, that has been drawing people together in a unique way, is
							online dating.
						</p>

						<p>
							This case study will be focusing on exploring the online dating experience with Facebook’s
							new feature embedded in the
							official Facebook application. Using the existing matchmaker applications such as Tinder,
							Bumble, and Hinge to compare
							them with Facebook Dating. Furthermore, I will also conduct testing and identifying problems
							through the conceptual
							design and mapping between the controls and the system display.

						<h2 class="major">Corvid-19 Contacter Tracer Smartphone application</h2>
						<p>As COVID-19 has drastically impacted student lives across the globe, many products surrounding 
							this issue have been developed and shipped worldwide. 
							However, many of these products, including the ones that Northeastern University currently uses, 
							is not always the most user-friendly and intuitive. 
							Therefore, the goal of this project was to develop a product that would act as a one-stop-shop for all COVID-19 related 
							activities at Northeastern.
							In this report, we have highlighted the overall design process of our product, the findings of our usability tests, 
							and how we plan to incorporate the user’s feedback into our final iteration of our product.

						<p>This project was a part of our academic course – Object-Oriented Design. This easy animation
							project focused on creating
							an animator that had multiple views which rendered the animation by utilizing JAVA
							Object-Oriented Design principle. Through collaboration, my teammate and I also included
							customizable options which allowed the user to manipulate the speed, start/stop point, and
							other aspects of the
							animation. Due to my agreement with the institute, the university requested students not to
							set the assignment codes
							publicly. However, I’m happy to send the file to whomever upon any request.</p>
